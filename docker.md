# Docker tips

## Docker desktop on linux

### Getting started
1. Use docker desktop for linux, running in non-privileged mode

2. systemctl --user start/stop docker-desktop works on the command line

3. Storing passwords to something like quay.io requires some setup.  It uses
  "pass" to store passwords, which in turn encrypts with gpg2.

 a. gpg2 --gen-key , which gives you a key pair to use.  Use the pub key id
   in the next command

 b. pass init 254B134537A95BE082D401095DE03B7023F568C5

 c. docker login quay.io, use the creds generated by quay.

 d. at this point, docker push will still fail.  It will try to use the key
   but because it has a passphrase, can't.  And the ability to ask for one
   doesn't work automagically.

 e. export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

 f. docker push quay.io/rh_ee_jseutter/hello-world:latest should now work
