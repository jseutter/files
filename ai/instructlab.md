# What is InstructLab?

InstructLab is a tool that Red Hat uses, co-developed with IBM.
It helps train LLMs.

InstructLab uses a methodology called Large-scale Alignment
for chatbots (LAB), which is:

1. Taxonomy-driver data curation
2. Synthetic data generation
3. Iterative alignment tuning

This is a way to simulate having a large dataset to work
with through only having a small dataset, and makes it
easier for sole devs or small teams to modify models.
